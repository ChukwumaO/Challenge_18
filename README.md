# Challenge_18

## PyChain
A blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface that allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

---

## Installation
import [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) as st - to build and share data apps
from [dataclasses](https://peps.python.org/pep-0622/) import dataclass - this allows a clean and safe support of algebraic data types in Python.
from [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) import Any, List
import [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) as datetime - supplies classes for manipulating dates and times
import [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) as pd  - For data analysis and manipulation.
import [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) - implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms.

## Ojective
To create the PyChain and test the complete PyChain ledger and user interface by running the Streamlit application and storing some mined blocks in the PyChain ledger. Then test the blockchain validation process by using the PyChain ledger.
